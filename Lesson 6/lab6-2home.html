        <p>Welcome! As most may know, PlayStation was created by Sony in 1994. Japan is well known for their video game systems and video games. I grew up playing videos games and owned every PlayStation console to date. <img class="psbutton" src="psbutton.png">  PS1 was one of the most popular consoles in the 90s. It was the first console to ship over 100 million units in under a decade.</p> 
        <p>We will dive deeper in the history of the PlayStation later. I wanted to create this website to show my love for the PlayStation brand and love for video games. Please enjoy this page from a true PlayStation fan!</p>
