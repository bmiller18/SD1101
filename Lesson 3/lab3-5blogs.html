        Okay, first things first, yes this is a HUGE city. There are crimes that happen every day, just like in any other big city. That is a given. However, Naples has the reputation of being a horrible, crime city. Pick pockets, gun shots, break ins, etc etc. I’ve heard countless times, don’t wear this, don’t bring that, should I wear my wedding ring? I mean, really?! Did you take this precaution in the other cities you have visited in Italy, let alone Europe? Okay, I know, it happens, but why is Naples the one everyone talks about?
        <br><br>I’ve been here for a year and some days. It took a lot getting used to this huge, noisy city. Naples is a beautifully, imperfect Italian city with historic buildings and landscapes. Yes, crimes do happen here, like I said. People, especially tourists, need to do better research before judging or simply just come experience it for yourself. There are, like any other city, good and bad areas to be in. You won’t find me in certain areas after dark. But, HELLO, that’s everywhere. When I lived in Gastonia, NC, USA, there were many areas I didn’t ever want to go, day or night. All I am saying is, Naples get the shit end of the stick when it deserves so much more.
        <br><br>Like I stated, I have been here officially over a year now, I have walked, rode the metro, hopped on the bus, and literally walked all the way home across the city in the dark, with two other females. NOTHING HAPPENED. Now, I am definitely not saying it can’t or won’t ever happened. All I am saying is, I am alive, never been shot at, pick pocketed, or even talked to in a wrong way. The citizens of Naples that I have had the pleasure of meeting or talking to have all treated me like I was one of them. I can walk up the street to go to the store by myself and they help me or simply talk and make sure I get what I needed. I dislike how this beautiful, lively city has such a bad reputation when it is complete opposite.
        <br><br>To sum up everything, yes, crimes happen here. No, Naples isn’t near as bad as people think it is. Come and see for yourself. I will gladly take you on one of our adventures as we like to call it. Napoli, Italia deserves all that the city brings us. Appreciation, respect, and love. People talk so badly about Naples, and I have yet to understand why. Everyone has their opinions, but mine will forever stay the same. Naples is beautiful, inside and out! </blockquote>

    <p id="p01" style="text-align: center;"><b>A Trip to the Most Beautiful Seafront in the World - Written 4/2/2016</b>
      <br>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/pg/millerinnapoli/notes/">Yesterday, April 1st, we decided to take a trip to go to one of the most famous places in Naples. A place where the tourists go to see one of the most beautiful views of Mount Vesuvius, grab a famous margherita pizza with a Peroni, and walk down Via Caracciolo. Shops everywhere. Pizzerias, pubs, restaurants, bars, anything you could possibly need to experience Naples all in one area. Mergellina is the place to be! 
        <br><br>Mergellina is one of the first places Maria and I saw when we first arrived to Naples. The second we stepped out of the metro station, we fell in love with our surroundings. When you first arrive, you walk down Via Toledo, which is lined with shops and restaurants of all sorts. Anything you can think of buying, you can get here. At night, it’s the best time to go. The lighted streets are beautifully busy with all kinds of different people. It’s an experience everyone should go through.
        <br><img src="piazzaplebiscito.jpg">
        <br><br>As you walk further, you arrive at Piazza Plebiscito, which is a great spot for tourists to take pictures. I have taken many photos here. Every time we get to the piazza, I can’t help myself. I have to take a picture of this beautiful place. This was the piazza last night. This is a must stop for tourists and residents here. Now, the next stretch is towards the sea. I can feel the sea breeze from here.
        <br><br>As you walk past the piazza, you start seeing the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Vesuvius. As you walk down, you come to one of the most famous streets in the area, Via Caracciolo. Here, you walk down the beautifully lite sea fronts in the world. The fresh sea breeze and smells from the restaurants are amazing. Skateboarders, bikers, in-line skaters, runners, walkers, etc. come here for their morning and evening routines. Romantic walks with their loved ones or buddies, this is the place to do it. It is said to be the most romantic place in Naples, where people fall in love. Who wouldn’t, with the beautiful sea crushing against the rocks, the wind through your hair, and the city lights surrounding you. 
        <br><img src="nightatsea.jpg">
        <br><br>I could literally stay up all night, walking down this beautiful street, looking out at the sea in the darkness and wait for the sun to rise. This place is beautiful at any time of the day, but there is something about it at night. I love walking down here, with a cold beer in hand, with my love, sitting down, enjoying the breeze and looking out at sea. Sitting on the rocks is fun too, but I prefer that during the day time. You have the freedom to do things that in most places you cannot, such as walking around drinking a beer, walking to your favorite spot on the rocks, swimming at night if you want, and anything else, that doesn’t put others at risk of course. 
        <br><br>You see couples strolling down the seafront, friends hanging out, families out letting their kids play, merchants selling their goods, people just simply enjoying life. That’s what I love about this place. People know how to ENJOY life to its fullest. Life is more laid back and less stressful.“No matter what stresses I have in life, right now, in this moment, they all go away.” Said by my one and only, Maria as we were looking out at the Mediterranean Sea in Mergellina last night. These are the moments I will remember for the rest of my life. </blockquote>

    <p id="p01" style="text-align: center;"><b>Let's Get Lost - Written 4/22/2016</b>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/pg/millerinnapoli/notes/">It definitely wasn’t a normal Thursday yesterday. I’ve seen Naples from a different view, which is always beautiful. I walked down many stairs, maybe I should have kept count! Anyway, let’s go on a little adventure together and GET LOST! P.S. There are more pictures in this one. We originally went to Vomero to go to the American stores for coffee creamer. They ended up not having any, so we decided to just walk around some. We ran into a place call Pat & Harry. There, they offer original American Cheese Steak. Maria and I shared a sandwich and enjoyed a beer here and it was delicious! After sitting here for a little bit, we walked and walked. We walked down streets we have never been. And here the adventures started.
        <br><br>We walked down so many stairs, it was insane. I wish I would have counted all of them, but these are the real streets of Naples. BEAUTIFUL! I might be hurting today, but I wouldn’t change it for anything. The steps were not the normal size either. They were a lot wider than I am used to. That’s what I have found since coming here. They seem like they are easier to walk, but after a while I realized maybe not. By the time we were close to Via Toledo, I was happy that we didn’t have to walk back up.
        <br><img src="steps.jpg"><img src="walking.jpg">
        <img src="backalleys.jpg">
        <br><br>Walking down and seeing Naples and the Mediterranean Sea with the ports and boats, the beautiful villas, and the twists and turns, I felt like I was in one of those Italian movies. I loved being able to look in between the buildings and trees, being able to see what was below. It was a different way of looking at this beautiful city. The gorgeous villas we dream to live in. One day! We were even able to see one of the islands that is off the coast here. I cannot wait to be on our way to one soon (hint, hint).  It was just a great experience to see different places. I would recommend everyone to experience the many side streets and little residential streets here in Naples. It is simply a beautiful experience. 
        <br><img src="islands.jpg"><img src="buildings.jpg">
        <img src="villas.jpg">
        <br><br>We finally finished walking down all those stairs and we came to Via Toledo. We walked right out where the metro station was, went down the street and looked at all the shops and then came to where the most beautiful sights as you already know from my previous blog. Every time we come here, it is always a new experience. We definitely got here differently this time. I love the breath of fresh air, the sea breeze through my hair, and the smile on our faces. We grabbed a beer and enjoyed a good 30 minutes here. Then, we ended back up Via Toledo and hopped on the metro to get back home.
        <br><img src="ships.jpg">
        <br><br>I love going on these little adventures through this city. No matter how much I think I have seen, I always run into something new. I will set out to see as much of this city as it is possible. I cannot wait for future trips and destinations of all kinds. Be on the look out for many more. Hopefully less stairs next time!! Until then.... Ciao for now!</blockquote>
